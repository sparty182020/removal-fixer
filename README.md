# StrikeBot App
This is a striking system based on the *3 strike bot* template. You can now specify custom reasons for strikes and the bot will automatically send a message to the user with the reason for the strike. The bot will also automatically deal with punishments too.

## Recent Updates
- Added a new command to check the strike count of a user
- Auto-undo bans when removing strikes
- Custom strike reasons
- Private messages to users when being struck, having strikes removed, or when getting strikes reset
